android-connectionhelper
========================
Small app that helps me quickly choose the networking configurations on my Samsung I-9100 (S2).
Options now:
- No Internet (disable everything)
- Internet Only (only mobile internet enabled)
- Internet + Hotspot (Mobile internet plus wifi hotspot to share it)
- Wifi (just internet through wifi)
- Wifi or Internet (Both are enabled, if a known Wifi accesspoint is in range, it is used)

It assumes the following:
- Wifi AP (hotspot) settings are already set up properly
- Mobile Internet is set up properly
- Wifi is set up properly

Also, it's a first experience with Android Studio, combined with GitHub! I will have to check if there are useless files committed now that I should remove.

Java code is here: https://github.com/coostendorp/android-connectionhelper/tree/master/app/src/main/java/co/sparca/connsettings
