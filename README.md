========================
Small app that helps me quickly choose the networking configurations on my Samsung I-9100 (S2).
Options now:
- No Internet (disable everything)
- Internet Only (only mobile internet enabled)
- Internet + Hotspot (Mobile internet plus wifi hotspot to share it)
- Wifi (just internet through wifi)
- Wifi or Internet (Both are enabled, if a known Wifi accesspoint is in range, it is used)
